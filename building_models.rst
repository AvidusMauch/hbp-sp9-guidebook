Building models
===============


The Neuromorphic Computing Platform executes experiments performed on computational models of neuronal networks.

Both the experiment description and the model description must be written as Python scripts, using the PyNN_ API.

At the time of writing, both the NM-PM-1 and NM-MC-1 systems implement version 0.7 of the PyNN API.

The simulator of the NM-PM-1 hardware ('ESS') supports both versions 0.7 and 0.8.
